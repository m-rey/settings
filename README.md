# about
This is a collection of settings that I use and try to keep updated. It currently mainly consists of settings for browser addons. I try to keep the config file names unchanged whenever possible and useful, apart from removing things like timestamps.

Feel free to give feedback and suggest improvements, fixes, changes.

# related work 
I also maintain some addon collections with personal comments over at https://addons.mozilla.org that might interest you:
* condensed list of addons that I use daily: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/14957359/core/
* nice to have addons, that didn't make it into the core list above: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/14957359/nice-to-have/
